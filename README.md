### SETUP GUIDE (Linux)
-----------------------

 1. Download and install the Project under /var/www/html folder.
 
	**$ cd /var/www/html/**
	
	**$ git clone https://github.com/OxBravo/Resort_Website.git**
	
 2. After installation, run the below command in the terminal to set read, write, and execute permissions to files.
 
	**$ sudo chmod -R 777 /var/www/html/Resort_Website/**
	
 3. Then, we need to run setup.php to complete the remaining setup. However, setup.php is also used to reset this project, so this file needs to be secure. Thus, it is kept protected inside the admin folder and requires a username and password for access. Therefore, first, we need to log in to the Dashboard. After logging in, we will gain access to execute setup.php.
 
	**• USERNAME AND PASSWORD OF DASHBORD**
	
		USERNAME --> admin
		PASSWORD --> password
		
	**• LOGIN TO DASHBOARD**
	
		DASHBOARD LINK --> http://localhost/Resort_Website/admin.html

	**• EXECUTE setup.php**
	
		SETUP LINK --> http://localhost/Resort_Website/admin/settings/setup.php

4. The last step is to set our database details. In this step, you need to open the source code with any editor software and set your hostname, username, and password in database.php.
